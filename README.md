# Welcome to my mind! 
I am currently a model who is **paving a new path as a developer**. I am passionate about technology and studying at EBAC (British School of Creative Arts) to improve my skills and become an exceptional programmer.

I am a fast learner and always seeking challenges to further develop myself. I believe that **growth is a fundamental part of success** in any career, especially in the field of technology, where innovation is constant. I am excited to face new challenges and expand my knowledge in programming.

When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games as a form of relaxation. I am a big fan of strategy and RPG games, and find it amazing how these games can develop skills such as decision-making and problem-solving.

Additionally, **I am a music lover** and always looking for new artists and genres to listen to. Music is a great source of inspiration and motivation for me.

**I am excited** to explore the many opportunities that programming offers and cannot wait to see what the future holds for me as a developer. If you are interested in technology or just want to chat, feel free to get in touch!
